# Frontend developer assignment

The goal of this project is to assess your development skills suitable for a software developer position with focus on frontend. It tests knowledge and proficiency with problem solving, software design and building user interfaces / interactions.

## 15 Puzzle

The goal of this task is to create a 15 puzzle. A 15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing.

### The puzzle must be implemented the following way:

1. On page load tiles order should be randomized.
2. The board size (number of columns and rows) should be configurable, and support a rectangular configuration (M x N board size)
3. The tile size should be configurable.
4. Must be performant for a large grid (e.g above 30x30).
5. Should support adding multiple boards.
6. Validity checks. Every board should be solvable.
7. A success message should be displayed when all the elements are reordered properly.
8. Tiles should be animated and slide to the designated area (Nice to have).

### UI Requirements

Please implement the simple UI wireframes outlined below. Minimal styling is acceptable.

#### Constraints

#### You may

- Develop only for Chrome.
- Use any feature available in the latest stable release of Chrome.
- If you don't have time to implement the optional animation component, your code should still be written in a way that could potentially support it without major refactoring.
- Use CSS animation for tiles animation.
- Class-based architecture (ES6 classes preferred).
- Assume that your code will be served from a simple web server.

#### You must not

- Use any build tools or preprocessors (npm, webpack, PostCSS, etc.)
- Use any frameworks or libraries (Angular, jQuery, React, etc.)

#### Marking Criteria

**Your code should be clear and easy to understand:**

- Avoids unnecessary complexity / over-engineering
- Brief comments are added where appropriate
- Broken into logical chunks
- Follows a module pattern

**Your code should be performant:**

Gives feedback to the user as soon as possible (perceived performance) ? UI remains responsive

**Submit your project:**  
You can add your project to github or any other provider and send us the project URL.

**Next steps...**  
We will have a look at your project, then we will schedule a session to go through your code together.
